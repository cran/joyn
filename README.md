The goal of `joyn` is to provide the user with a set of tools to analyze
the quality of merging (i.e., joining) data frames, so that it is a
**JOY** to join tables with `joyn`. This is inspired on the command
`merge` of the statistical software `Stata`.

## Motivation

The objective `joyn` is to make your life easier when joining tables. As
a former Stata user (I still work with Stata but not that much as I work
with R now), I had missed, until now, the ability to assess the
resulting data frame when joining tables in R. With one single command,
`merge`, Stata allows the user to perform any kind of equi-join. The
reason for this is that, by default, Stata merges fully both tables into
one and then it is up to the user to keep the observation she needs.
Most importantly, Stata forces the user to know how her joining tables
relate to each other. Most tables have a one-to-one (1:1 ) relation, but
it is common to find one-to-many (1:m), many-to-one (m:1), and
many-to-many (m:m) relations. Finally, Stata’s `merge` command returns
by default a variable with useful information about the table’s join. So
the following features are the value added of `joyn`:

1.  `joyn` performs a full join by default (i.e., resulting table has
    all the observations from both original, joining tables). Yet, the
    user can select “left”, “right” or “inner” joins using the argument
    `keep`.

2.  In the same vain, `joyn` keeps all the columns form both joining
    tables. Two caveats are worth mentioning.

    1.  If both tables have variables with the same name, by default
        `joyn` does not bring those variables from the second (i.e,
        right, using) table into the first (i.e., left, master) table.
        Yet, you can do one of two things. First, you can use arguments
        `update_values` or `updateNA` to update the value of those
        variable in the first table with the ones in the second table.
        Or, you can use argument `keep_y_in_x = TRUE` to keep both
        variables with a different name.

    2.  You can use the argument `yvars` to select which variables you
        want to bring from the second table into the first one.

3.  `joyn` allows the user to perform one-to-one (1:1) , one-to-many
    (1:m), many-to-one (m:1), and many-to-many (m:m) joins. The default
    is m:m, following general R’s practice, but its is highly
    discouraged. Since you want to use `joyn`, I recommend you always
    specify the right relationship between your joining tables.

4.  `joyn` returns a reporting variable with the status of the join.

## Regarding speed and flexibility

Notice the `joyn` is not intended to be a super fast joining tool. By
construction, it does a lot of things that will make it slower than
other tools out there. However, `joyn` is basically a wrapper around
`data.table`’s indexed joining tools. So, the lost of speed of `joyn` is
mainly due to evaluating several conditions, creating the reporting
variable, and present a nice summary table at the end of the process.
Also, keep in mind that `joyn` is intended to be informative, so it
displays messages here and there to inform you about your join (you can
silence any message in `joyn`, including the reporting table, by using
the argument `verbose = FALSE`). This, of course, makes `joyn` a little
slower than using regular `data.table` syntax. However, the loss of
speed is not much and you’re gaining a lot of information. The main
reason why `joyn` is a little slower is than pure `data.table` is that
it will always perform a full join of data in the same way the `Stata`
does it.

As of now, the flexibility of `joyn` is limited to the basic joins, yet
the most used and useful ones. If you want to learn more about different
kinds of joins available in `data.table` and how they relate to `dplyr`,
I recommend you start with this [blog
post](https://atrebas.github.io/post/2019-03-03-datatable-dplyr/#joinbind-data-sets).

## Installation

You can install the stable version of joyn from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("joyn")
```

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("randrescastaneda/joyn")
```

## Example

``` r
library(joyn)
