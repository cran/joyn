\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame: referred to \emph{left} in R terminology, or \emph{master} in
Stata terminology.}

\item{y}{data frame: referred to \emph{right} in R terminology, or \emph{using} in
Stata terminology.}

\item{by}{a character vector of variables to join by. If NULL, the default,
joyn will do a natural join, using all variables with common names across
the two tables. A message lists the variables so that you can check they're
right (to suppress the message, simply explicitly list the variables that
you want to join). To join by different variables on x and y use a vector
of expressions. For example, \code{by = c("a = b", "z")} will use "a" in x, "b"
in y, and "z" in both tables.}

\item{yvars}{character: Vector of variable names that will be kept after the
merge. If TRUE (the default), it keeps all the brings all the variables in
y into x. If FALSE or NULL, it does not bring any variable into x, but a
report will be generated.}

\item{match_type}{character: one of \emph{"m:m"}, \emph{"m:1"}, \emph{"1:m"}, \emph{"1:1"}.
Default is \emph{"m:m"} since this is the default generally used in joins in R.
However, following Stata's recommendation, it is better to be explicit and
use any of the other three match types (See details in \emph{match types
sections}).}

\item{keep}{character: One of \emph{"full"}, \emph{"left"}, \emph{"master"}, \emph{"right"},
\emph{"using"}, \emph{"inner"}. Default is \emph{"full"}. Even though this is not the
regular behavior of joins in R, the objective of \code{joyn} is to present a
diagnosis of the join, so that it must use by default a full join. Yet, if
\emph{"left"} or \emph{"master"}, it keeps the observations that matched in both
tables and the ones that did not match in x. The ones in y will be
discarded. If \emph{"right"} or \emph{"using"}, it keeps the observations that
matched in both tables and the ones that did not match in y. The ones in x
will be discarded. If \emph{"inner"}, it only keeps the observations that
matched both tables.}

\item{update_values}{logical: If TRUE, it will update all values of variables
in x with the actual of variables in y with the same name as the ones in x.
\strong{NAs from y won't be used to update actual values in x}. Yet, by default,
NAs in x will be updated with values in y. To avoid this, make sure to set
\code{update_NAs = FALSE}}

\item{update_NAs}{logical: If TRUE, it will update NA values of all variables
in x with actual values of variables in y that have the same name as the
ones in x. If FALSE, NA values won't be updated, even if \code{update_values} is
\code{TRUE}}

\item{reportvar}{character: Name of reporting variable. Default if "report".
This is the same as variable "_merge" in Stata after performing a merge. If
FALSE or NULL, the reporting variable will be excluded from the final
table, though a summary of the join will be display after concluding.}

\item{reporttype}{character: One of \emph{"character"} or \emph{"numeric"}. Default is
\emph{"character"}. If \emph{"numeric"}, the reporting variable will contain  numeric
codes of the source and the contents of each observation in the joined
table.}

\item{roll}{double: \emph{to be implemented}}

\item{keep_y_in_x}{logical: If TRUE, it will keep the original variable from
y when both tables have common variable names. Thus, the prefix "y." will
be added to the original name to distinguish from the resulting variable in
the joined table.}

\item{sort}{logical: If TRUE, sort by key variables in \code{by}. Default is
TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{logical: if FALSE, it won't display any message (programmer's
option). Default is TRUE.}

\item{allow.cartesian}{logical: Check documentation in official \href{https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/reference/merge.html/}{web site}.
Default is \code{NULL}, which implies that if the join is "1:1" it will be
\code{FALSE}, but if the join has any "m" on it, it will be converted to \code{TRUE}.
By specifying \code{TRUE} of \code{FALSE} you force the behavior of the join.}

\value{
a data.table joining x and y.

This is the main and, basically, the only function in joyn.

\section{match types}{


Using the same wording of the \href{https://www.stata.com/manuals/dmerge.pdf}{Stata manual}

\strong{1:1}: specifies a one-to-one match merge. The variables specified in
\code{by}  uniquely identify single observations in both table.

\strong{1:m and m:1}: specify \emph{one-to-many} and \emph{many-to-one} match merges,
respectively. This means that in of the tables the observations are
uniquely identify by the variables in \code{by}, while in the other table many
(two or more)  of the observations are identify by the variables in \code{by}

\strong{m:m} refers to \emph{many-to-many merge}. variables in \code{by} does not uniquely
identify the observations in either table. Matching is performed by
combining observations with equal values in \code{by}; within matching values,
the first observation in the master (i.e. left or x) table is matched with
the first matching observation in the using (i.e. right or y) table; the
second, with the second; and so on. If there is an unequal number of
observations within a group, then the last observation of the shorter group
is used repeatedly to match with subsequent observations of the longer
group.
